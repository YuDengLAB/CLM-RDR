# DeepEDR
Deep-learning for enhancing the dynamic range of glucarate biosensor DeepEDR is useful for predicting the dynamic range of biosensor designed by various cross-RBS(cRBS). The cRBS sequence dataset used to train DeepEDR is rationally designed by analysis of variance (ANOVA) and WebLogo. DeepEDR is useful for achieving the fine-tuning of biosensor.
